# Node Introduction

Bottos nodes are divided into basic service nodes, application nodes, light nodes and ultra light nodes.
Each node balances and complements each other to form a dynamically balanced node self consistent system.

(1) basic service node

The basic service node provides the basic services of the whole Bottos block chain system. Besides supporting the core functions of the block chain, such as transaction consensus, contract deployment and block production, it also supports the main functions provided by the Bottos service layer, such as unified identity system, storage management service, credit service, Token management and contract management. Its main functions are to provide the main production services for the overall Bottos network.

(2) application node

The application node mainly serves for different DApps deployment in the ecosystem. The application node can be deployed either by itself or by the base node. (future deployment of the basic node's logical App application can charge a certain deployment threshold fee).

(3) light node

Light nodes are mainly used as data validation nodes of Bottos. They do not provide the corresponding functions of service layer, only carry out block data synchronization and other functions, which can support the basic services of Bottos core layer.

(4) ultra light node

Ultra light nodes mainly deal with block related header verification, synchronize key HASH data, etc.
