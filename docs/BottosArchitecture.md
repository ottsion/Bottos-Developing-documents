# Bottos Architecture

Bottos is an infrastructure that focuses on the field of artificial intelligence. It has both the underlying public chains specially designed for data characteristics and the data flow platform serving the entire AI and its derivatives industry. Bottos'data flow is the world's largest data pool based on block chain technology, which solves the pain of high-quality data acquisition in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, creates intelligent data equity contracts, uses data mining to achieve personal data wealth sharing, and establishes value links between personal data and AI models.

Therefore, a hierarchical architecture is adopted in the design of Bottos system to facilitate the dynamic expansion and flexible deployment of the system. The total is divided into three layers, as follows:

Core Layer: Chainbase layer, which provides chain services based on block chain, builds trust common chain infrastructure, and implements basic functions of block chain.

Service Layer: Based on Chainbase, we provide basic services based on platinum chain development, such as distributed identity services, distributed storage, contracts and Token management services, to achieve rapid Dapp development.

Application Layer: various application collections developed based on Bottos.

This article mainly introduces how to use Core Layer, the Block Chain Basic Service, to provide the corresponding development interface and use cases, and to provide the basic interface and way of purse.

The overall technical framework of the Bottos system is shown below.
