# Deploying and Testing

# 1. Contract deployment

Prerequisites for deploying the contract: compile the wasm file generated by the contract, scan the generated ABI file, and an account in the following format:

```
./bcli contract deploycode --name testhelloworld --code testHelloWorld.wasm  --abi testHelloWorld.abi

```

See BclI command description.

# 2. Contract call

Invocation contracts essentially send a transaction to a chain, as described in the link port for sending transaction information.
