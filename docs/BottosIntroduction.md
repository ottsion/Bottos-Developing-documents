# Bottos Introduction



Bottos is an infrastructure that focuses on the field of AI. There are not only the underlying public chains specially designed according to data characteristics, but also the data flow platform serving the entire artificial intelligence and its derivatives industry. A consensus-based, scalable, easy-to-develop, and collaborative one-stop application platform for data, model, computation, and storage of multi-level shared services is implemented through data mining and intelligent contracts.

Bottos can be used in big data, artificial intelligence, intelligent hardware, robots, the Internet of Things, VR / AR and other fields. Simply put, Bottos is not only a common chain of artificial intelligence, but also has both data and model flow services, realizing the value flow of artificial intelligence and its derivatives based on data feeding, and eventually forming a new distributed AI ecology.

Bottos-based public chains are designed to serve the AI industry, and their performance advantages are concentrated in data flow, computing, storage and sharing, etc., with strong industrial attributes. Its original technical features include smart currency design, lottery dPOS algorithm and distributed storage with AI algorithm. It has a leading competitive advantage in data privacy protection, super-large data storage and so on.

Bottos Foundation Service Chain aims to build a decentralized data flow platform, solve the pain points of AI training data acquisition, and attract AI and its derivatives to actively enter the platform. Through data and model confirmation, encourage users to share and speed up the transaction flow. Intelligent contract life cycle management helps AI and its derivatives to eliminate trust costs and improve efficiency.

Bottos application development layer is mainly DApps, which is divided into three categories: artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence derivatives, block chain technology services. Block chains such as lightning network, Oralce, side chains, cross chains and so on, mainly to improve the Bottos ecology, with the iteration of block chains technology and constantly increase; artificial intelligence DApps represented by pure software, with data feeding model iterative upgrade as a feature;

Artificial intelligence derivative DApps include intelligent hardware, Internet of Things, robots and so on. It collects new data through hardware and is the source channel of AI data.

These DApps form the demand closed-loop of data between each other, and eventually form a global-scale data aggregation pool. At the same time, there is also demand among the intelligent modules of DApps. The demand mapping is formed through the block chain technology, and eventually a huge module aggregation pool is formed.
