# Network Topology

### Super node network

Super nodes undertake the execution and recording of all transactions in the whole network, which is the basis of the stability of the whole network. Therefore, the Bottos chain in the design of the super node network adopts the full-connection network. As shown in the following figure(Take the full connection of 10 super nodes as an example. The actual number of super nodes is 49, of which 29 blocks are selected for each round, and the other 20 nodes are selected as alternative.)

### Connection diagram between other nodes and super nodes

Other types of nodes, except supernodes, are loosely organized networks, similar to the mesh structure in the following figure
